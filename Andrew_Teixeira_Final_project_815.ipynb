    "\n",
    "**Question 1: What is the correlation between sex and survival?**\n",
    "I sought to figure out a few characteristics and determinants of survival aboard the Titanic. \n",
    "After analysis, I have determined that Sex was a characteristic \n",
    "highly correlated with survival (correlation = 0.543351). \n",
    "If you were a woman, you survived at a higher rate as well than if you were male.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2: What is the correlation between fare paid and survival? **\n",
    "Fare paid also had very little correlation with survival. At the inital glance, the 3 individuals who paid\n",
    "the maximum fare all survived, while 14 out of 15 passengers who paid the minimum fare perished. I would have\n",
    "guessed this would have resulted in higher correlation between fare and survival, but this was not the case. \n",
    "\n",
    "A scatter plot showed that the maximum payers were true outliers in the dataset, and there expenditure and survival\n",
    "were the exception to the rule aboard the titanic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actually correlation for fare paid and survival was 0.257307.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 3: What is the correlation between age and survivial? AND**\n",
    "**Question 4: What is the correlation between age (for children) and survival?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suprisingly, age was not highly correlated with survival (Correlation = 0.077221). I approached this analysis with the assumption\n",
    "that older individuals would be highly correlated with death while younger with survival, but a Pearson\n",
    "correlation showed that to be not the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, for children, the correlation was stronger with survival (0.208059) than viewing age in its totality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 5: Who is the oldest survivor, youngest survivor, oldest deceased, and youngest deceased?**\n",
    "I wanted to know more about the survivors and those perished, notably, who was the oldest and youngest survivor, \n",
    "and who were the oldest and youngest who perished. After extracting names, I sadly learned that the youngest\n",
    "age of death was 1 years old aboard the Titanic, and tragically, 7 children fit that age. \n",

    "**Question 6: What is the mean age per class aboard the titanic?**\n",
    "I also wanted to examine the relationship between age and class. It turns out that the average age of a 1st class\n",
    "passenger was approximately 13 years older than that of the 3rd class passenger, logical when you consider \n",
    "wealth accumulation takes time. The first class passenger mean age was 38.233441, second class was 29.877630, and \n",
    "third class was 25.140620.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 7: What is the survival percentage, based on this data, if you are a female, and what is the survival percentage**\n",

    "**Limitations to the analysis:** Firstly, the dataset does not contain all the information regarding every \n",
    "passenger that was on the Titanic. In fact, when looking at sex, we saw that the data heavily skews towards\n",
    "female passengers than male passengers, both in totality and in survivors and number deceased. Though we\n",
    "found sex to be highly-correlated with survival, this may not be the case should the researcher have had\n",
